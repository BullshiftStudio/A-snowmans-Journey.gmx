---PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE CONTINUING---

In order for this to work fluently and avoid asset issues, we need to establish some
rules. Possibly break some habits...

First is asset names. We should make them the same...
This is an example of a uniform way to create assets:

Sprite: spr_Sprite
Sound: snd_Sound
Background: b_Background
Path: pt_Path
Script: scr_Script
Font: fnt_Font
Time Line: tl_Timeline
Object: obj_Object
Room: rm_Room

Make all Macros captital as well: MACRO

This will help us stay organized.

---CODING GUIDLINES---

Any statements (e.g., if, then, switch, with, etc...) should be layed out like this:

if (statement = true) {

    content = here;

}

Put spaces after commas and math symbols so things are easier to read.
